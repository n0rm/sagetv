 * This plugin interface does not allow for overriding the built in format detection 
 * for MPEG2-TS/PS, MP3 or Images.  This is intended to be able to replace the
 * FFmpeg format detector only.

   * SageTV will pass a file to this method when it needs to know its format.  This 
   * could be because it is the first time it saw the file, or because SageTV needed to
   * rediscover the file format because of some other trigger. The implementor should 
   * construct a ContainerFormat and provide information about the media file.
   * 
   * <pre>
   * 
   * For most media files you will need to do the following
   * 
   * Set the container format of the file with this method.  For example "MKV", "AVI"
   * <code>
   * ContainerFormat.setFormatName(formatName);
   * </code>
   * 
   * Set the duration of the file in milliseconds
   * <code>
   * ContainerFormat.setDuration(duration);
   * </code>
   * 
   * Set the total bitrate of the file
   * <code>
   * ContainerFormat.setBitrate((int)bitrate);
   * </code>
   * 
   * Create the associated stream object for each stream in the file
   * For video streams use VideoFormat
   * For audio streams use AudioFormat
   * For subtitles use SubpictureFormat
   * It is important that for each stream you set the setOrderIndex.  This should be 
   * the index that the stream exists in the file.  So normally the video stream would be
   * index 0, and your first audio stream would be index 1.  Your second audio stream would be
   * index 2 and so on.
   * <code>
   * ContainerFormat.setStreamFormats(streams);
   * </code>
   * 
   * </Pre>
   * If you return a container format with no streams, SageTV will discard your ContainerFormat and use it's own format
   * detector to attempt to determine what the files format is.
   * 
   * @param file Media file to determine the media format for
   * @return ContainerFormat populated with the format of the given file.  If you retrun
   * a null ContainerFormat, or an empty list of streams, sage will ignore your container
   * format.
